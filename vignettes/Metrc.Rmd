The Metrc API allows third-party software to comply with many state's Marijuana regulations. Metrc provides documentation for the API [here](https://api-co.metrc.com/Documentation/). This document expands about Metrc's documentation.

## Intro

Managing information from seed to sale involves a lot of steps, and many different data structures that are not discussed in detail in Metrc's documentation. We will go through each section of the Metrc API and describe the data structures used. We will also give more detailed examples.

## Facilities

Every area where Marijuana is grown, dried, processed or sold has to be approved by the state. Information about all facilities a user has access to is available at the facilities endpoint. Most API calls require the facility's license number as a parameter, so we depend on this endpoint a lot.

## Rooms

Facilities contain rooms for individual tasks. Very little information is kept about rooms except for their name. The rooms endpoint has information about rooms, and the ability to edit, create, and delete rooms.

## Employees

All workers in the Marijuana business must be approved by the state. They are registered on a per facility basis, so each worker must be approved for each facility they work in. Information about a facility's employees is accessible via the employees endpoint. Seemingly the only information is the employee's name, and their license number. Information about employees does not appear to be used anywhere else in the API (i.e. you don't have to enter the employee who processed each sale/transaction).

You cannot add employees using the API.

## Strains

Marijuana has many different strains, which have different attributes. The strains endpoint lets you view, edit, add, and delete information about strains. If the strain has been tested, lab information about the strain is available. All marijuana has a strain associated with it starting at seed or clone. 

## Units of Measure

This endpoint provides all the acceptable units of measure. It has no parameters. This information is useful because it defines the inputs used by many other endpoints. There are two types of units: count-based, and weight-based. Items like clones are sold by unit, and not by weight, so we would use the "each" quantity type. Flower is sold by weight so we would use one of the weight-based quantities.

## Items

Items are types of products. Shops do not sell items specifically, but rather packages (discussed below), which are specific instances of items. Items are facility specific. A specific strain of bud would be an item. 

All items have a category from the categories endpoint, which defines some of the item's attributes.

Items can be updated, and removed. You can also view individual items, and all active items. 

Items have a unit of measure, but do not have any quantity. Items describe packages which contain quantities. 

## Packages

Packages are physical quantities of items. You should think of a package as a batch of an item. The packages endpoint has a lot of info including two ways to access specific packages, and info for all active, onhold, or inactive packages. 

You would think the types endpoint would be different package types, but packages don't have those attributes, the items they are an instance of do, so the items endpoint contains what you would consider the different types of packages. The types endpoint here indicates that harvested plants can result in either: an item, or seeds (or clones, but not really since only vegetative plants can be harvested into clones real life. See [harvest](#harvests)). 

The create plantings endpoint here is for seeds/clones (probably just seeds in practice) derived from existing packages. 

The create endpoint allows you to take packages and turn them into other packages (i.e. 10 Ounces of bud used to generate hash).

The testing endpoint is for creating packages that will be tested (and presumably consumed in the testing process).

All changes in quantities must be reported using the adjust endpoint. 

Similarly, any actions taken to alter to the package (i.e. drying the buds) must be reported using remediation endpoint. When creating a package, we must indicate whether it requires remediation, which is a fancy way of asking "is this a final product or does is require further processing?" Requires remediation means requires further processing. 

When you have zero inventory of a package you have the option to "finish" the package, which renders it inactive. If you do this, and then wish to undo this the unfinish endpoint lets you activate inactive packages. The reason packages are not automatically marked inactive when their inventory goes to zero is that in theory the quantity can be adjusted to add more. Suppose a package weighs 2 Ounces, and is placed in a jar to be sold at the shop in a humidor. Let's say the batch adds some weight do to the humidity, so once the shop sells the 2 Ounces in the system there is still a residual quantity left in the jar. We would not want to automatically inactivate this package because there is still some remaining quantity. The shop must add this residual quantity using the adjust endpoint, and explicitly finish the package when the inventory is exhausted. 

## Tag Label

Although not directly a part of the API, tag labels are a key part of the Metrc regulatory scheme. All plants must receive a tag label, as well as all products. Tags must be purchased from Metrc. You cannot order, or view available labels with the API. It also appears labels must be assigned using Metrc not the API, but I could be wrong. 

# Seed to Sale

Now that we understand the basic objects we can apply them. The seed to sale process can be divided into three stages: growing, processing, and selling. Metrc monitors all of these stages, and the transfers between these stages. 

## Growing

## Plant Batches

The growing process begins with the plant batches endpoint. All plants begin as either seeds or clones at a specific facility. The createplantings endpoint is where new seeds or clones are entered into the stem. We must enter a strain from the strain endpoint when we create the seed or clone. Metrc calls this stage immature. A better name probably would have been unplanted. 

Once clones, or seeds are planted they enter the vegetative state. You would enter this change in the changegrowthphase endpoint. We must enter the [room](#rooms) the plant in grown in, which must be one of the rooms in the facility's room endpoint. Once a plant is in vegetative state we can add a Tag Label

Similarly, when the grower initiates the flowering stage this must be noted using the changegrowthphase endpoint. 

The key unit is "count" at this point. 

This endpoint provides several other bits of functionality:

* View individual, active, or inactive batches. Inactive includes both plants that you have destroyed, and plants you have harvested in the past. Active includes only plants that are currently in the immature, vegetative, or flowering stages. 

* Destroy plants: often times the problems arise during the growing process and batches of plants do not survive. When plants are discarded this must be recorded using the destroy endpoint.

* When cuttings are taken from vegetative or immature plants they are called clones, and they become new immature plants. This endpoint is an alternative to the createplantings endpoint. When you receive seeds or clones from another facility the create plantings is the endpoint; when you harvest seeds or clones from plants in the same facility use the create packages endpoint.

* The types endpoint indicates the two types of immature plants: seeds and clones. 

* Metrc's own software appears to include the ability to add/monitor the nutrients used while growing. Unfortunately this functionality is outside the scope of the API.

## Plants

Plant batches are made up of individual plants. Information about individual plants is accessible by either ID number or label.

You can also view all plants in each growing stage: vegetative, flowering, onhold, and inactive, which includes destroyed, and harvested plants. 

This endpoint allows you to:

* Move plants from one room to another.

* All the same functionality from plant batches, but on a individual level. This includes changing growth phases, destroying plants, creating clones and seeds. The reason for this duplication appears to be because plant batches includes immature plants, while plants only includes vegetative and flowering plants. So if you destroy, or create a clone from immature plants it has to be done on the plant batches level. 

* Harvest and manicure plants. When we record harvesting and manicuring we must enter the room, the weight of the results of each individual plant, and the [unit of weight](#unit-of-weight). There is seemingly no way to edit the quantity of the harvest afterwards. The difference between manicuring and harvesting is that when we harvest we consume the plant, which renders it inactive. When manicuring, only part of the plant is removed.

## Harvests

Once manicured or harvested you can view the results via the harvest endpoint. You can view harvest info by id, or view all active, onhold, or inactive harvests. 

There is also functionality for:

* Converting harvests into [products](#products). 

* Often times portions of the harvest are discarded. This is reported as waste with the removewaste endpoint.

* Finish and unfinish harvests. This is the same idea as packages. You must explicitly finish a harvest after packaging or disposing of all the entire quantity. You cannot finish a harvest with remaining stock. The harvest info doesn't know with certainty that the plant batch it came from is complete (it could be the result of a manicuring not a harvest) so it is possible that more plants will be manicured/harvested from that plant batch, so finishing the product when its quantity is zero may be incorrect. 

## Processing

So now we have finished growing Marijuana, and we have harvested it into products, mainly buds and shake at this point. 

## Transfers

Rarely is Marijuana grown in the same facility it is processed, lab tested, or sold from so we will likely have to transfer this product to another facility for processing, testing or selling. The API does not allow you to generate transfers, only to view information about transfers.

## Lab Tests

When packages are lab tested the results are entered via the lab test endpoint. There are five types of tests: THC, THCa, CBD, CBDa, and pesticide. This endpoint also provides fixed states for tests (i.e. not submitted, test failed, etc.), but there does not appear to be a status parameter when you enter information about the lab tests, so it is unclear where this information is used. 

## Selling

## Patients

So now we've grown Marijuana and packaged, processed, tested, and transferred it to our selling facility. For Medical shops we must verify that all sales are made to a legitimate patient or caregiver. Patients must signup at each facility they purchase from, so the active patients list is facility specific.

You can add patients to your facility using the add endpoint. You can edit, and remove patients as well. The patient license number will be used during sales. If the facility is recreational this endpoint is moot.

## Sales

The sales endpoint lets you retrieve information about past sales/transactions, and create new ones. All sales are made to one of three types of buyers: consumer (regular recreational sale), patient, or caregiver. 

There are two primary data structures here: receipts, and transactions. An individual entering a store, and making a purchase is is a receipt; the individual packages sold in the receipt are the transactions. So every sale has one receipt, and each receipt can have multiple transactions. 

The receipt endpoint allows you to enter the transactions for that sale, so it isn't clear what the value of the transaction post endpoint is. Perhaps it is for wholesale transactions, but I suspect that is related to transfers, and beyond the scope of the API.
